## Summary

This document describe the 2nd prize solution approach to Africa Soil
Property Prediction Challenge. [Soil-Prediction challenge](http://www.kaggle.com/c/afsis-soil-properties).
In this competition it is required to
predict 5 target soil functional properties from diffuse reflectance
infrared spectroscopy measurements. 
The solution consists of two steps: Data preprocessing and model
prediction. For the preprocessing stage, we used 2 methods, one
applied for target 1-4 (PIDN/Ca/P/pH/SOC ) and the other for target 5 (Sand).
The second step was to feed the processed features to a neural
network. In order to ensure that the CV error is stabilized, we had
to average enough models. We ended up with 100 models to get
reasonably stable error.  

## Feature selection and extraction

In order to optimized the prediction results, the main effort
concentrated on feature dilution and processing. We first decimated the
features by 8, in a standard manner, we low pass with a 16-tap hamming window and
then decimated by 8. This decimation is coarse and ignores data with
different type (such as Topsoil/Subsoil etc.) 
We also skipped features 41-99 as they do not contains much
information. We ended up with 391 features. For target 5 
(Sand) this used as the input (after linear
normalization) to a 2-layers neural networks with 1-4-4-1 architecture.
For target 1-4 we did more processing. First, we calculate the
derivative (difference sequence) resulting 390 features, then centering
the results and the last stage is enhancing strong variance features.
This is done by (point-wise) multilying the features by the data
standard deviation vector (normalized to range 0-1).


## Modeling Techniques and Training

At the start of the competition we tried using few commonly used ML
models such as SVM, KNN, neural networks etc. We quickly noted that
in, all models, the cross validation creats a strong noise. Adding the
fact that the training set and test set are relativly small in size
(1158 data elements for the training and 727 elements for the test
set) it was clear that overfitting is a big issue here. This make the
LB results very problemtic.

Our model used matlab implementation of neural networks, trainlm.
This uses the robust levenberg-marquet algorithm. The layer
architecture was 1-4-4-1 (2 hidden layers). We trained the model with
5-fold cross validation and averaged 20 times. (overall 100 model
average).

## Dependencies
* The scripts requires MATLAB 2014 with Neural Network Toolbox and Statistics Toolbox.


## Code
The code is matlab script, provided in repository [2].
The main script is soil.m, includes model building, training and submission.
